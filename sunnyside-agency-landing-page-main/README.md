## My process
- I started the solution with a mobile workflow approach.
- No CSS library framework involved
- made the media query with the min-width since it was mobile design first before large screen.
- this challenge took me a while to finish because i was learning how to make the navbar work with JS for the mobile design.
- According to my html layout ,created the header section where i designed the navbar first, followed by the header design and the rest follows

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS



### What I learned

- This will be my first attempt on JS challenge through frontend mentor, although this colution took me a while to figure out mainly ecause of the JS involved.

- I learnt how to use eventlistner in making my navbar work with JS.

 code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

<button class="mobile_nav_toggle" aria-controls="nav__list" aria-expanded="false"><span class="sr-only">Menu</span> </button>
```


```js
the conditional statement
```




### Continued development

My continuous development will be focused more on learning JS and how to apply them properly
